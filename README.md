# Amazon Pricing Analysis

This study investigated how Amazon product pricing has evolved from 2021 to 2024 relative to broader inflation trends represented by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Using Amazon pricing data from Keepa across multiple product categories and CPI datasets from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we analyzed the correlation between Amazon pricing and inflation. These data sets were used to determine whether Amazon's product pricing closely mirrored general inflation trends or if other factors like competition, algorithm-driven pricing decisions, and consumer purchasing behaviors led to noticeable deviations. Exploring these patterns across multiple years enabled a detailed understanding of Amazon's pricing strategies within the context of wider economic changes.

## Study Summary

Using various methods of data analysis, the correlation between Amazon product prices and the CPI was explored. Visualizations such as line charts and scatter plots showcased pricing trends across different product categories, highlighting changes over time and revealing instances where Amazon prices moved in parallel or diverged from CPI trends. By examining these trends, other price adjustments became evident, which helped identify potential influences beyond inflation.  

A permutation-based hypothesis test was then conducted to further identify the relationship between Amazon and the CPI. The combination of these analysis methods provided insightful results displaying the relationship between inflation, and other factors that shape Amazonâ€™s pricing strategy.

**Key Findings:**
- Amazon prices and CPI show statistically significant correlation in certain market segments (e.g., food).  
- Divergences exist in categories like toys and apparel, where competition, algorithmic pricing, and consumer dynamics play stronger roles.  
- Amazon prices may **lead or lag CPI trends**, complicating the determination of true market dynamics.  

**Limitations:**
- CPI categories lack direct product-level alignment with Amazonâ€™s dataset.  
- Timing mismatches between CPI reports and Amazon pricing shifts reduce precision in trend attribution.  

**Implications:**
- Consumers gain insights into how pricing aligns with inflation, supporting informed purchasing decisions.  
- Retailers and analysts can learn from Amazonâ€™s pricing strategies to refine their own dynamic pricing models.
